# Starks-HUD
I have been working on this hud for awhile now and I've gotten it to a point where I want to release the first functional version to the public.

This addon will eventually be added to gmodstore.com once its ready enough.
I plan on adding alot more to this addon when I release the full version.

At this moment the hud has features such as:

1. Heads up display
2. Custom notifications
3. An overhead display
4. A custom door display

Right now there isnt much special about this addon and it still needs optimization but if you would like to try it out on your server go ahead.
